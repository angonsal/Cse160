      <h3> Notes To Grader</h3>
      <p> This assignment was pretty fun! I made Wile E. Coyote from Looney Tunes. When you click the animate button, the "meep meep" sound from the cartoon plays (linked source below). I made him hold a white surrender flag because usually in the cartoons he is trying to attack the Road Runner and always ends up failing and getting hurt. He's waving a surrender flag because he gives up. The animation is his arms moving up and down, as if he is waving for help. The shift-click animation is his ears moving back and forth, to make it more cartoon-like. The joint sliders control his shoulders, forearm, and wrist. I struggled a lot with the animation and getting the shift-click animations to work, but I figured it out after a few hours. For my non-primitive shape, I used a Trianglular Prism because his ears are very large and triangular. I also made his tail and the white flag trianglular prisms. I also made a mountain for him to stand on so it looks like hes on top of a dangerous, steep mountain. </p>
