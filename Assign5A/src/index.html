    <p>You probably wont see this on the html page, but I will write it 
      anyways and copy and paste to canvas comments. This project is very fun!
      My goal is to create a quidditch scene from Harry Potter. The shapes in
      this scene are a cube, cylinder, sphere, and torus. The rings are toruses
      and the stick is a cylinder. The grass is a cube, and the ball on the floor
      (quaffle) is a sphere. I added textures to the grass and the wood under the
      rings. I added an animation to the middle ring to look cooler. For my object, 
      I added a cat. I'm thinking of also adding a toad and an owl because those
      are the main pets in Harry Potter. I added directional light to make the cat 
      more visible. </p>
