    <h1>Welcome to the Wizarding World</h1>
    <p> Welcome to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter! We are pleased to meet you. 
      Currently, we are having a bit of trouble... Hagrid seems to have lost his unicorns! There are
      3 of them. Can you help us?! Travel along the quidditch field where you will meet our school 
      cat and toad. West of the quidditch field, we have the forbidden forest where darkness 
      and evil lurks... Right in front of the entrance, we can find Hagrid's Hut: The Keeper of Keys 
      and Grounds and Hogwarts! Travel north from the quidditch field, we meet Hagrid's pet dragon! 
      He may look menacing, but he's actually vegetarian. Travel east from the quidditch feild, we have the
      magical forest! You can find magical rivers and beautiful trees. Travel south, and you will encounter 
      the famous Hogsmede Village! Hogsmede is home to many local shops and fun excursions.
