    <p>You probably wont see this on the html page, but I will write it 
      anyways and copy and paste to canvas comments. This project is very fun!
      My goal is to create a quidditch scene from Harry Potter. I added over 20 shapes; 
        and 4 different types of light sources. There is also a skybox which looks like 
        a quidditch field, and orbital controls. I added a frog in addtion to the cat because 
        those are two very popular pets at Hogwarts. I added two boxes of quidditch balls because 
        in this scene they are playing quidditch. I added a table on both ends of the field; one with 
        a trophy, and one with the sorcerer's stone.
